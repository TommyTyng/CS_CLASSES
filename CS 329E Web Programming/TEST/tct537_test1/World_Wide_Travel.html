            <h3>Bora Bora</h3>

            <p>
                The Island of Bora Bora is one of the French Polynesia Leeward group of Islands and is based around an extinct volcano and two peaks. The peaks are named Mount Pahia and Mount Otemanu, respectivly. Bora Bora is one of the most secluded islands on the planet. To demonstrate this, sample this; the Island of Hawaii gets more visitors in 10 days than the whole of French Polynesia gets in a whole year! If you put a flower on your left year, it is an indication that you have someone special in your life. If on the other hand you put it on your right ear, it means you are looking and Bora Bora natives will spoil you with flirts. Doesn't sound half bad huh! I give this location a ten out of ten and is a MUST visit!
            </p>
            
            <h3>Telluride, Colorado</h3>
            <img class="floatright" src="mountains.jpeg" alt="Mitt Romney" width="200" height="220">
            <p>
                Telluride is tucked into a box canyon surrounded by 13,000- and 14,000-foot peaks, and is just eight blocks wide and twelve blocks long. Because of its significant role in the history of the American West, Telluride was designated a National Historic Landmark District in 1964. This small ski town in Colorado is a great, summer spot too! Yeah I said it.... SUMMER! With great hiking trails, fishing, shops, water-activities, and scenic views you can not go wrong with this summer destination. The flowers are blooming and the hippies are smoking.

The construction of the Taj Mahal was begun in 1632, a year after the death of Empress Mumtaz. The construction was completed in the year 1653, which means that it took approximately 22 years to complete this astounding piece of architecture. At that time, the estimated construction cost was a whopping sum of Rs. 32 million, which, when considered in terms of today’s value of money, would be something way above $1 billion. The Taj Mahal being the dedication and homage of Mumtaz Mahal, it has calligraphy all over the interior and exterior, which, among other patterns and holy inscriptions, also has calligraphy on the tomb that identifies and praises Mumtaz Mahal. Another interesting fact is that there are 99 names of Allah found on the sides of the actual tomb as calligraphic inscriptions. After all, Shah Jahan did envision Mumtaz’s home in the paradise, and Taj Mahal was that imagination coming to life. Hop on this deal now and SAVE SAVE SAVE!!!
