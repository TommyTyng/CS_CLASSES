			<h2>These Beats Will Get The Party Going!</h2>
			<h3>Mr. Carmack Drops Dark, Eerie, & Melodic Beat “Warsaw, Canada”</h3>
            <img class="floatleft" src="warsaw.jpg" alt="warsaw" width=100%>
			<p class="description">As Mr. Carmack states in the SoundCloud description of his brand new track, he “hasn’t made a beat in a month.” The last little piece of genius that he dropped was the brutally hard “This Is America.” Considering it’s some of the best we’ve heard from Carmack, it was going to be difficult to follow up, but he had to put out something sooner or later.

Today, Mr. Carmack dropped “Warsaw, Canada” a tightly knit, dark and eerie beat that plays around with some dreamy melodies. The general array of sounds that Carmack utilizes in this beat is hypnotizing on its own, but he still manages to find a solid groove that will keep your head bobbing throughout the whole track.

Honestly, this almost feels like a throwaway beat for Carmack, the way he nonchalantly dropped it out of nowhere, with hardly any support on his social media. But even then, a throwaway beat from this legend is better than some artist’s whole catalogs. Keep doing what you’re doing, Mr. Carmack.

Stream “Warsaw, Canada” below and enjoy!</p>

            <h3>Justice Shows Off Their Insane Live Version Of “Chorus” Off Forthcoming Live Album</h3>
            <img class="floatleft" src="justice.jpg" alt="justice" width=100%>
			<p class="description">The new Justice live album, Woman Worldwide, is just around the corner, and the legendary French duo have given us another little taste of what is to expect. 

Justice dropped a live version of “Chorus,” giving a huge energy boost to the already powerful track. The original had a nostalgic 80’s vibe going, but this new version turns those levels down to bring up a whole new wave of intensity to the track, blasting electro house vibes that will surely get your blood pumping.

Based off of what we’ve heard so far, Woman Worldwide, is going to be insane. The project is set to drop August 24 via Ed Banger Records / Because Music, so be ready next Friday when this thing lands.

Stream the new live version of “Chorus” below and enjoy!</p>

            <h3>Gramatik Pays Tribute To Aretha Franklin With Funky, Emotional New Single “Let Me Know The Way”</h3>
            <p class="description">
                Yesterday we lost one of the most influential artists in music history, Aretha Franklin. For over half a century the Queen of Soul’s powerful voice touched the hearts of countless peoples across the world and inspired generation upon generation of young artists. Today, as we reflect upon the impact that Aretha has had on the world of music, that to pay respect to the late singer and pianist, Gramatik has shared a tribute titled “Let Me Know The Way”.
                
                Sampling “The Long And Winding Road”, Gramatik crafts a soulful, rhythmic boom-bap type beat around Aretha’s distinctive vocals, perfectly capturing the emotional, larger-than-life feeling that could only be achieved by the late Queen. Check out “Let Me Know The Way” below and enjoy.
