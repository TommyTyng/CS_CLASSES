			<img class="floatleft" src="ReoCragen.png" alt="reo cragen" width=100%>
			<p class="description">Reo Cragun is back! The rising rapper & singer has been steadily rising for the past couple years with his incredible voice and songwriting impressing us every time he puts out new music. It's been a few months since we heard from him and today he's decided to upload a loose single on SoundCloud titled "Last Goodbyes" and it's amazing. 
                
                The minimal beat by Apollo7even provides the perfect melodic backdrop for Reo's vocals to shine. He truly has one of the best voices in R&B right now and has the bars to match. We're hoping he has some more tracks on the way soon, or decides to leak some because this is fire. Enjoy!

            <h3>Mr. Carmack Drops Dark, Eerie, & Melodic Beat “Warsaw, Canada”</h3>
            <img class="floatleft" src="warsaw.jpg" alt="warsaw" width=100%>
			<p class="description">As Mr. Carmack states in the SoundCloud description of his brand new track, he “hasn’t made a beat in a month.” The last little piece of genius that he dropped was the brutally hard “This Is America.” Considering it’s some of the best we’ve heard from Carmack, it was going to be difficult to follow up, but he had to put out something sooner or later.

Today, Mr. Carmack dropped “Warsaw, Canada” a tightly knit, dark and eerie beat that plays around with some dreamy melodies. The general array of sounds that Carmack utilizes in this beat is hypnotizing on its own, but he still manages to find a solid groove that will keep your head bobbing throughout the whole track.

Honestly, this almost feels like a throwaway beat for Carmack, the way he nonchalantly dropped it out of nowhere, with hardly any support on his social media. But even then, a throwaway beat from this legend is better than some artist’s whole catalogs. Keep doing what you’re doing, Mr. Carmack.

Stream “Warsaw, Canada” below and enjoy!</p>

            <h3>Rising Producer pluko Shares Debut Album 'sixteen' Via Foreign Family Collective</h3>
            <img class="floatleft" src="pluko.jpg" alt="pluko" width=100%>
			<p class="description">Here at TSIS, we have been anxiously awaiting pluko’s debut album sixteen. The rising producer has been building hype around the album with previously released singles such as “l o v e”, “pink.” and “asleep”. Now today, the 12-track package has been unleased in its’ entirety via Foreign Family Collective, and it most certainly exceeds the high expectations. Featuring eight new tracks, sixteen embodies pluko’s unique production style that has provided the foundation to the 18-year-old’s rapidly growing popularity.

The opening track “lost” sets the tone for the remainder of the album; crisp, high-energy, captivating and unique. Following, sixteen contains various styles of music across the broad spectrum of genres. From experimental instrumentals such as “flight”, “forgiveness” and “no, not yet”, to poppy crowd-pleasers such as “need ya” and “asleep”, all the way to the R&B / Hip-Hop inspired sounds as heard in “his perspective”. pluko’s debut album is an impressive showcase of undeniable talent that is sure to catapult the promising artist’s career to the next level. Enjoy!</p>
