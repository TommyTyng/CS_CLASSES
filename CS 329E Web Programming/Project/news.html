			<p class="description">Tcfghe largest playlist in the world for dance and electronic music is the mint playlist from Spotify and they recently just hit a milestone, breaking 5 million followers. To celebrate such a huge achievement they launched their first ever line of mint branded merchandise.

They put a little more thought into this and actually partnered up with the incredible To Write Loves On Her Arms organization and all proceeds are going to be supporting mental health.

Austin Kramer, Spotify Global Dance & Electronic programmer, is not only the person behind curating the mint playlist, but was the driving force of this initiative. This is what he had to say about it.

            <h3>Chicago Rapper Mick Jenkins Drops Hard-Hitting New Song "Bruce Banner" & Announces Forthcoming Albummi</h3>  
			<img class="floatleft" src="mike.jpg" alt="mike" width=100%>
			<p class="description">Mick Jenkins just gave us some amazing news… along with a fire new track. The Chicago rapper has just shared the news his new album is coming soon as his first full album since his 2016 project The Healing Component. Along with this, he’s delivered a hard-hitting new song “Bruce Banner.”

While his last project was soulful, this new song is dark and just filled with straight bars as he calls out his competition saying “honestly can’t nobody come for me except Kendrick.” This new track comes with an eerie beat while we hear Mick go in for lyrical verses changing his vocal inflections throughout, even sounding like Aesop Rock at moments. He puts his impressive vocal dexterity on full display, skipping along the hard-hitting beat. This is more aggressive than we’ve hear Mick on a lot of his raps and can’t wait to hear what else is in store. Enjoy!</p>
