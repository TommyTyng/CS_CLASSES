            <h3>Barclay Crenshaw Puts Forth Spacey New Bass Mix “Transmission 003”</h3>  
			<img class="floatleft" src="crenshaw.jpg" alt="crenshaw" width=100%>
			<p class="description">With Claude VonStroke being pretty busy over the past few months, it’s no surprise that we haven’t heard much from his spacey bass music alter ego, Barclay Crenshaw. The last we heard from Barclay, he had just dropped very dope remix of Bon Iver. Yesterday he dropped off a brand new 30-minute mix, “Transmission 003,” which also happens to be an AMF Music Festival exclusive.

If you’ve heard any of Barclay Crenshaw’s mixes, you can expect more of the same of his otherworldly bass music, mixed in with an assortment of hip-hop. Included in this “transmission” is music from BROCKHAMPTON, Mad Zach, Tinyghost, and much more.

Barclay will be one of many dope artists who will be playing AMF Music Festival. He’ll be alongside RL Grime, M.I.A., Jamie xx, and plenty more. Check out more information regarding AMF Music Festival here, and listen to Barclay’s brand new mix below. Enjoy!

Among the many different styles of dance music that will be present at Shambhala, a few members of the Dirtybird crew will be present to add their eccentric energy to the party. Dirtybird is bringing along some of their best artists to Shambhala: Claude VonStroke, Justin Martin, Christian Martin, Fisher, and Kyle Watson.

To get a taste of what kind of beats these guys will be laying down at the Pagoda stage, check out this brand new, Shambhala exclusive mix that was crafted by none other than the Dirtybird label head, Claude VonStroke.
