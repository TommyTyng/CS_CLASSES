			<h2>Must Hear Artist!</h2>
			<h3>Rainbow Kitten Surprise reaches new heights on “How to: Friend, Love, Freefall”</h3>  
			<img class="floatleft" src="RKS.jpg" alt="RKS" width=100%>
			<p class="description">Rainbow Kitten Surprise meshed pure poetry with memorable melodies and impassioned drumbeats to make their latest album, How to: Friend, Love, Freefall, just as magnificent as their past works.

RKS released its new masterpiece on April 6 in the midst of a headlining tour, which stopped at D.C.'s 9:30 Club on April 8. The band will also make rounds during festival season, with shows at Lollapalooza, Velorama Festival and more.

Lead vocalist Sam Melo has one of the most unique sounds in music. His deep and throaty voice is fueled by an expansive range that allows him to exert the deep monotones of "Mission to Mars" and reach the feathery highs of "Fever Pitch." See tracklist below and enjoy!

            <h3>Earthgang is the new Outkast</h3>  
			<img class="floatleft" src="earthgang.jpg" alt="earthgang" width=100%>
			<p class="description">Doctur Dot begins Royalty with an accurate assessment: “I’m the latest phenomenon you should be hip to, bandwagon seats going extinct.” EarthGang has been around for a while, but as of late, their stock has been skyrocketing. After extensive touring and a deal with J-Cole’s Dreamville Records in August, the Atlanta duo promised an EP trilogy leading up to their third album Mirrorland. Six months and two excellent EPs later, EarthGang concludes the movement with Royalty.

Over a roughly twenty-five minute span, Doc and Johnny Venus somehow manage to revitalize the hip-hop trope of being on the cusp of greatness. The rhyming is complex, the production luxurious; the songs even transition together to form a cohesive narrative. The five tracks are interspersed with skits by comedian DC Young Fly, who reprises his role as an Uber driver slash narrator. Unlike the previous two chapters, Doctur Dot and Johnny V are the passengers this time around, travelling through contemplations of fame as they steer towards Mirrorland. See the track below and enjoy!

            <h3>Only Real balls out</h3>  
			<img class="floatleft" src="onlyreal.jpg" alt="onlyreal" width=100%>
			<p class="description">Niall Galvin, aka Only Real, has been drip-feeding us tracks from his debut album for more than two years now. Establishing himself as a lackadaisical Jamie T, or grittier Mac DeMarco, Galvin started recording in his bedroom when he was only 18, fusing drawled raps telling of lazy London fun with blissful surf-pop.
With a bit of help from producers Dan Carey (Hot Chip, Childhood) in London and Ben Allen (Washed Out, Deerhunter) in Atlanta, 'Jerk At the End of the Line' has been filled out by woozy psychedelic guitars and 80s drum machines whilst still retaining the urban grit and playfulness of Galvin's bedroom demos. 
Make no mistake though, sunshine aside this is a breakup album - and there's real moments of uncertainty and melancholy to be found buried beneath the fuzz, guitar-jangles and nonchalant swagger. 'Break It Off' is especially revealing, showing a different side to Galvin ("I thought it would be me to break it off / Well look at me now."). Recent single 'Yesterdays' has a pure-pop chorus that, despite shimmering guitars, pines with longing. Lyrically, the darkest moment on the album comes with 'Can't Get Happy' which sees Galvin moping after a breakup: "I lay defeated / Things aren't getting better / Do you think of me at all?"  See Cadillac Girl below and enjoy!
