            <h3>PREMIERE | Conro Makes TSIS Debut On Bouncing Electro Funk Single "Trippin"</h3>  
			<img class="floatleft" src="tsis.jpg" alt="tsis" width=100%>
			<p class="description">One of our favorite music festivals north of the border, Shambhala, is now just right around the corner. In less than two weeks (from August 10-13), some of the best artists from all realms of electronic music will gather at the infamous Salmo Silver Ranch in the West Kootenay region of Southern British Columbia, Canada. 

Today we have the pleasure of introducing rising Canadian producer Conro with the premiere of his irresistible new song "Trippin" via Monstercat, and it's definitely going to be stuck in our head for a minute. 
                
                Conro crafts an infectious beat characterized by the deep, funky bassline while his bouncing synths and crisp percussion lay the perfect foundation for the whispy vocals to float buoyantly atop. Conro's background in music started playing in rock n' roll and alternative bands before moving into electronic production while living in a 25ft trailer working security in a boatyard. We're excited to see where Conro goes from here. Enjoy!
