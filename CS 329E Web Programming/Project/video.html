            <h3>Tyler, The Creator Drops Amazing Self Directed Music Video For ‚ÄúSee You Again‚Äùty</h3>  
			<img class="floatleft" src="tyler.jpg" alt="tyler" width=100%>
			<p class="description">Ever since Tyler, The Creator debuted his self directed music video for ‚ÄúYonkers‚Äù back in 2012, he‚Äôs shown that he can be one of the best in front of (and behind) the camera. His ridiculous videos for tracks like ‚ÄúShe,‚Äù ‚ÄúRella,‚Äù ‚ÄúOKRA,‚Äù and ‚ÄúWho Dat Boy‚Äù have all been seriously impressive as well, so it‚Äôs fair to say that we‚Äôre excited for any new video drop by Tyler.

Today, Tyler dropped another self directed video of one of the best tracks off of his 2017 album Flower Boy, ‚ÄúSee You Again.‚Äù He again comes through with yet another extraordinary music video with vibrant colors, creative concepts, and bizarre characters. Along with Tyler, Kali Uchis performs her verse in the video, and there‚Äôs also a brief cameo of A$AP Rocky.

As per usual, Tyler concludes the video with another little video snippet of an additional track. This time he ends with an eerie clip of him performing ‚ÄúWhere This Flower Blooms,‚Äù featuring Frank Ocean.

Check out the video below and enjoy!
