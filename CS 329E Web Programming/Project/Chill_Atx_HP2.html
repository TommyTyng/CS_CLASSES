			<h2>Today's New Music!</h2>
			<h3>Rising Rapper & Singer Reo Cragun Delivers Amazing Chill New Single "Last Goodbyes"</h3>  
			<img class="floatleft" src="ReoCragen.png" alt="reo cragen" width=100%>
			<p class="description">Reo Cragun is back! The rising rapper & singer has been steadily rising for the past couple years with his incredible voice and songwriting impressing us every time he puts out new music. It's been a few months since we heard from him and today he's decided to upload a loose single on SoundCloud titled "Last Goodbyes" and it's amazing. 
                
                The minimal beat by Apollo7even provides the perfect melodic backdrop for Reo's vocals to shine. He truly has one of the best voices in R&B right now and has the bars to match. We're hoping he has some more tracks on the way soon, or decides to leak some because this is fire. Enjoy!

			<h3>Just A Gent Drops Impressive Remix Of GTA: San Andreas Theme Song</h3>
            <img class="floatleft" src="gent.jpg" alt="gent" width=100%>
			<p class="description">
				Just A Gent has done it again with another fire remix. While he’s been seemingly focusing on his originals, the Aussie has returned to form, this time taking on the theme song to Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas for a fresh new remix titled “Grove St.” In the description he says he’s been opening his sets with this lately and we’re loving it. He utilizes the elements of the classic theme song while making it his own, introducing new wobbling, bouncing basstones and song harder-hitting percussion. Enjoy!

            <h3>Gramatik Pays Tribute To Aretha Franklin With Funky, Emotional New Single “Let Me Know The Way”</h3>
            <img class="floatleft" src="gramatik.jpg" alt="gramatik" width=100%>
            <p class="description">
                Yesterday we lost one of the most influential artists in music history, Aretha Franklin. For over half a century the Queen of Soul’s powerful voice touched the hearts of countless peoples across the world and inspired generation upon generation of young artists. Today, as we reflect upon the impact that Aretha has had on the world of music, that to pay respect to the late singer and pianist, Gramatik has shared a tribute titled “Let Me Know The Way”.
                
                Sampling “The Long And Winding Road”, Gramatik crafts a soulful, rhythmic boom-bap type beat around Aretha’s distinctive vocals, perfectly capturing the emotional, larger-than-life feeling that could only be achieved by the late Queen. Check out “Let Me Know The Way” below and enjoy.
