A.) To play the game, click on the correspong the cat the application tells you. There are a certain number of cats to select and the player must do so before time runs out or it is GAME OVER. To recieve hints, click on the hint button on top of screen during gameplay and the right icon will spin in a circle for you, but be careful because on Lion mode when you click a wrong icon, that wrong icon will twirl. Every icon missed in lion mode results in a 5 second time deduction. 
B.) Features completed:

	1.) Splash Screen: Load my logo while the game is loading.

	2.) Main Menu: Includes buttons that were created using rounded_button.xml. The code that helped me make these buttons was found at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10266595/how-to-make-a-round-button. The about game button took the player to a new activity called about game. It just used strings and xml to create this activity and screen. The blow kittens up button to the player to the entry activity. 
	3.) Entry Activity: inlcudes a mode enum and a slider to crontol sound effects and partially control the music volume. 
	4.) Mode enum: Defines three modes (endless, kitten, and lion). Difference in difficulty come with time deductions and more cats to click on.
	5) Gameplay: There are cat emoji that appear on screen that either explode when correctly pressed or twirl when incorrectly pressed. There is also a hint feature that twirls certain cats. There is a timer that countsdown and will end the game when time runs out. 
	
C.) I did not complete the high score feature or have a function quit frgment. I decided not to have the quit fragment since player can navigate with the back button. I also did not have a background selector for the user and had an array of backgrounds that were randomized instead. I was not able to complete the music on and off option. I also did not inlcude lives as it seemed redudant.  

D.) Cat emojicons, animations of explosions, and hints were not apart of the prototype but they are in the beta. 

E.) I needed help figuring out how to make the hint rotate icons on the screen. I found a few sources helpful which will be linked at end because they were applied to multiples classes and xml files. This website was specifically helpful to this problem, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3137490/how-to-spin-an-android-icon-on-its-center-point. I applied this code to the xml code in the anim file. I also needed some guidance creating the mode section, this link was extremly helpful https://www.stacktips.com/tutorials/java/java-enum-programming-tutorial.I needed help figuring out how to get my song in the application and how to have sound effects. This link helped me with the mediaplayer (song) aspect, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11951420/how-do-i-loop-my-media-player-files. This link helped me with the soundpool (sound effects) aspect, https://o7planning.org/en/10523/playing-sound-effects-in-android-with-soundpool. For CatView these two links were helpful, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50988162/strings-and-integers-android-studio and https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28071272/android-studio-animation. For the mainactivity these two links were helpful with the timer and glyphs, http://blog.shamanland.com/2013/11/how-to-use-icon-fonts-in-android.html and https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4597690/android-timer-how-to.  

These links inserted were ones that I could find again, obviously there are a quite a bit missing that helped me with this project, but I can not find them all.  

F.) AboutActivity.java, activity_about.xml, activity_mainmenu.xml, in_game_menu.xml, QuitDialogFragment, MainMenuActivity, a lot of CatView, every xml file in values, all sounds were personally made except for the fart and explode noises which were downloaded online. Everything in drawable was made by me except the background images and  emojis. 

For every aspect of the project I had to look stuff up and learn stuff on my own, but I learned how to do certain things and was able to implement in the project as I worked through it and will take these skills with me outside of this class. Thank you Dr. Scott.
